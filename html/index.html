                        U.S. targets in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 23 times since Oct. 17, a senior U.S.
                        defense official said Monday.

                        The attacks have been conducted primarily with rockets and drones, said the official, and 14
                        have been against U.S. targets in Iraq and nine against U.S. bases in Syria. The official did
                        not report any U.S. injuries.

                        At least four of the attacks have come since the U.S. launched retaliatory strikes on two
                        Iranian-linked targets in Syria on Thursday.

                        Día de los Muertos is a colorful tradition to remember loved ones. Here's what it means.
                        A senior U.S. military official said that the two locations hit by the U.S. were a weapons
                        storage area and an ammunition storage area, and that the U.S. used precision munitions dropped
                        by two F-16s. No casualties were detected, according to the senior defense official.

                        Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the attacks launched by the U.S. last Thursday “separate
                        and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas” and said they don’t represent a
                        shift in the U.S. approach to the conflict.

                        Prior to retaliating, U.S. and coalition forces had been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and
                        Syria, according to defense officials. On Oct. 18, at least two one-way attack drones targeted
                        al-Tanf military base in southern Syria, U.S. Central Command said. On the same day, there were
                        two separate drone attacks against U.S. and coalition forces stationed at al-Asad base in
                        western Iraq. One American civilian contractor died of a heart attack while sheltering in place,
                        and 21 U.S. personnel suffered minor injuries, including 19 with traumatic brain injuries. All
                        those injured have since returned to duty.

                        On Friday, a defense official reported that another attack had occurred in Iraq, saying U.S.
                        forces had shot down a one-way drone “a few kilometers” from the Asad base.

                        The U.S. defines attacks as attempted strikes on U.S. facilities. Not all attempts actually
                        reach the U.S. targets.

                        Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said last Tuesday that the groups conducting
                        the attacks are supported by Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

                        “We always reserve the right to defend ourselves, and we will never hesitate to take action when
                        needed to protect our forces and our interests overseas,” he added.
